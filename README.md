# SmartPiHome
A Smart Home API for the Raspberry Pi 3.
# Control opportunities
You can control your Smart Home using the Telegram Messenger, a Website or with help of the Google Speech API. Control your Smart Home with WhatsApp would be possible too but the chance to get a ban is to high in my opinion.
